The Government of Gujarat has established the Special Investment Region Act, 2009, as a legislative framework for the creation of DSIR. Under this act, the Dholera Special Investment Region Development Authority (DSIRDA) was formed to oversee the planning, development, and administration of government land within the region.</p>
      <p>To implement the project, a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) called Dholera Industrial City Development Limited (DICDL) has been set up as a joint venture between the Central Government (DMICDC Trust) and the State Government (DSIRDA) of Gujarat. The Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation Limited (DMICDC), a special purpose entity, is responsible for promoting and facilitating the development of the DMIC project.</p>
       <p>Covering approximately 920 square kilometres and encompassing 22 villages in the Dholera Taluka of Ahmedabad District, DSIR is envisioned to be larger than the city of Ahmedabad. It is strategically positioned between major industrial cities such as Ahmedabad, Baroda, Rajkot, and Bhavnagar.
Dholera Industrial City aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem driven by industrialization, supported by utilities, logistics, social infrastructure like education and healthcare, and other public amenities. With the backing of the Government of Gujarat, DMICDC plans to develop a modern city that is economically and socially balanced, offering world-class infrastructure, high standards of living, sustainable urban design, and efficient transportation links to neighbouring cities and the rest of the country.</p>

                The significance of GIFT City (Gujarat International Finance
                Tec-City) in the context of the Indian economy is substantial,
                as it holds the potential to catalyze several key aspects,
                outlined below in greater detail:
              </p>
              <h3>Gift City will beat Singapore and Dubai's economy</h3>
              <h3>1. Boost to the Financial Sector:</h3>
              <p>
                GIFT City has been meticulously conceptualized to emerge as a
                pivotal hub for India's financial sector. The city boasts a
                meticulously crafted infrastructure and cutting-edge facilities
                tailored to the needs of banks, insurance firms, and various
                other financial institutions. By providing an environment
                conducive to growth and innovation, GIFT City is poised to not
                only expand the scope of India's financial industry but also to
                fortify the nation's stature as an economic powerhouse. This
                sectoral growth translates into enhanced economic dynamism.
              </p>
              <h3>2. Attraction of Foreign Investment:</h3>
              <p>
                The strategic amalgamation of business-friendly policies, its
                Special Economic Zone (SEZ) status, and state-of-the-art
                infrastructure positions GIFT City as a magnetic center for
                foreign investment. The city's ecosystem is primed to allure
                investments from across the globe, promising the dual benefits
                of job creation and the stimulation of economic expansion within
                India. This inflow of foreign investment could serve as a major
                driver in the evolution of the nation's economic landscape.
              </p>
              <h3>3. Nurturing Innovation and Startups:</h3>
              <p>
                GIFT City is characterized by its proactive emphasis on
                innovation and entrepreneurship. This orientation has the
                inherent potential to foster the burgeoning growth of startups
                and nascent enterprises. The supportive environment crafted
                within the city nurtures the incubation of novel ideas, which in
                turn fuels the engine of innovation. As these startups flourish,
                they contribute not only to economic diversity but also pave the
                way for a wave of employment opportunities across various
                sectors.
              </p>
              <h3>4. Diminishing Reliance on External Financial Centers:</h3>
              <p>
                A notable aspect of GIFT City's importance lies in its potential
                to alleviate India's reliance on foreign financial centers like
                Singapore and Hong Kong. The city serves as a compelling
                domestic alternative, offering world-class facilities for
                businesses seeking to expand their operational footprint within
                Asia. This shift has the potential to retain significant
                economic activity within India's borders, which, in the long
                run, contributes to increased self-reliance and reduced
                dependency on external financial infrastructures.
              </p>
              <h3>5. Fortifying India's Global Economic Standing:</h3>
              <p>
                By meticulously developing a financial nucleus in the form of
                GIFT City, India is poised to bolster its stature on the global
                economic stage. A robust financial center of this magnitude
                enhances India's influence within international financial
                markets. As GIFT City gains recognition and prominence, it
                contributes to projecting India's economic strength on a global
                scale. The city becomes a testament to India's commitment to
                progressive economic practices and a symbol of its growing
                presence in the international economic discourse.
              </p>

              <h3>Gift city will become future of indian economy</h3>
              <p>
                GIFT City's inception dates back to 2008, a time when fintech
                was still a relatively unfamiliar term, and Narendra Modi held
                the position of Chief Minister in Gujarat. The visionary concept
                aimed to transform this strategically positioned area into a
                thriving hub for global financial trade and commerce,
                streamlining bureaucratic hurdles and compliance procedures that
                often impeded progress.
              </p>
              <p>
                The overarching goal was to establish an enticing alternative to
                renowned financial hubs like Dubai or Singapore. The focal
                points encompassed various business sectors: capital markets,
                offshore banking, offshore asset management, offshore insurance,
                IT services, ITeS/BPO services, as well as supplementary areas
                such as legal, accounting, research, and analytics.
              </p>
              <p>
                To support its operations, the center was equipped with
                cutting-edge infrastructure, encompassing essential urban
                amenities and robust external connectivity. A significant
                responsibility involved overseeing international transactions,
                which the International Financial Services Centre Authority
                (IFSCA) diligently managed. The IFSCA's purview extended across
                capital markets, offshore banking, asset management, offshore
                insurance, and related domains. Notably, the center also
                provided leasing services for both ships and aircraft. Notably,
                the presence of two international stock exchanges in GIFT City
                contributed to an impressive average daily trading volume
                exceeding $11 billion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite initial skepticism from many quarters, the vision for
                GIFT City persevered. A turning point emerged roughly five years
                ago, as consecutive Union Budgets from 2015 onwards introduced
                incentives for GIFT City's growth. The International Financial
                Services Centre, geared towards serving overseas clients
                involved in cross-border finance and related services, commenced
                operations in 2015. Building upon this foundation, the IFSC
                Authority emerged in 2020, unifying regulatory oversight for all
                international financial services and instilling confidence
                within the financial community.
              </p>
              <p>
                Situated along the banks of the Sabarmati River, GIFT City is
                evolving into more than just a financial center. Plans include
                the development of residential complexes and cultural hubs,
                while the riverfront is poised for a transformation with the
                addition of cafes and restaurants. Moreover, discussions with
                foreign universities are underway to establish local campuses, a
                potential game-changer that could profoundly shape GIFT City's
                cultural landscape.
              </p>
              <p>
                In summation, GIFT City's importance is multi-dimensional,
                ranging from its potential to elevate the financial sector,
                attract foreign investments, fuel innovation, offer an
                indigenous alternative to external financial centers, and
                bolster India's global economic influence. It is not merely a
                project; it is a transformative initiative that has the capacity
                to shape India's economic trajectory for years to come.

                In 2008, the then-Gujarat Chief Minister Mr. Modi initially
                revealed that the state government would build a 'Nano city' and
                the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT) at
                Gandhinagar. Dealing with the 'Invest Gujarat' summit arranged
                by Assocham, Mr. Modi claimed that the land in between Ahmedabad
                as well as Gandhinagar would certainly be established as a
                Central Business District (CBD) with office spaces, residential
                apartments, schools, medical facilities, resorts, retail as well
                as various other recreational facilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                After an usefulness study was carried out by speaking with
                company McKinsey and also Co, present was launched as a joint
                endeavor in between the state-run Gujarat Urban Advancement Co.
                Ltd as well as Facilities Leasing and also Financial Providers
                Ltd (IL&FS), with a preliminary expense of Rs 78,000 crores. The
                city is intended on 886 acres of land with 62 million sq. ft. of
                built-up area with 67 percent commercial (42 million sq. ft), 22
                percent property (14 million sq. ft) and 11 percent social space
                (6 million sq. feet).
              </p>
              <p>
                Helmed by Mr. Ramakant Jha in 2009, the project was at first
                stalled due to the 2008 U.S economic recession. Nonetheless, it
                picked up pace by 2011 when the State government provided 673
                acres across Ratanpur, Firozpur, Valad and also Lavarpur at Rs.
                1. Headed currently by Mr. Tapan Ray, IAS (Retd.) as Handling
                Director & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, the city is 12 km from
                Ahmedabad's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Flight
                terminal as well as 8 kilometres from Gandhinagar on thebanks of
                the Sabarmati.
              </p>
              <h3>Change in focus from BKC</h3>
              <p>
                With Mr. Modi's altitude to Prime Minister in 2014, GIFT turned
                from a real-estate task right into India's very first smart
                city. While providing the 2015-16 Union Budget, the then-Finance
                Minister Arun Jaitley changed the Centre's emphasis from Mumbai
                to present as a potential international economic centre like
                Singapore or Dubai.
              </p>
              <p>
                Formerly, the Congress-led UPA federal government concentrated
                on creating Mumbai's Bandra-Kurla Complex as an economic center.
                In 2007, a government-appointed committee led by former World
                Bank official Percy Mistry suggested changing Mumbai along the
                lines of New York, London as well as Singapore with BKC at its
                centre. Ever since, Maharashtra government-run Metropolitan Area
                Growth Authority (MMRDA) has developed as well as advertised BKC
                as a location for worldwide business to house their Indian
                branches. However, with the Modi federal government's shift in
                focus to creating present as well as Mumbai's geographical
                restrictions, BKC has actually run into issues in its expansion.

                Bank official Percy Mistry suggested changing Mumbai along the
                lines of New York, London as well as Singapore with BKC at its
                centre. Ever since, Maharashtra government-run Metropolitan Area
                Growth Authority (MMRDA) has developed as well as advertised BKC
                as a location for worldwide business to house their Indian
                branches. However, with the Modi federal government's shift in
                focus to creating present as well as Mumbai's geographical
                restrictions, BKC has actually run into issues in its expansion.

                Gujarat’s largest mall will come up on S G Highway, at Zydus
                Hospital Crossroads. Phoenix group of Mumbai has inked a deal
                with Ahmedabad-based BSafal group to develop the Rs 1,000 crore
                mall which will offer more than 9 lakh square feet built-up
                space in a plot admeasuring 25,000 sq yard.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to sources close to the development, BSafal had bought
                this land in an auction from the Ahmedabad Education Society
                (AES), some time ago. The land alone costs around Rs 350 crore,
                including the stamp duty and registration charges. Since the
                land falls in the Residential-1 zone, the project will get 2.7
                FSI (Floor space index) which means the vertical construction
                will be about three times the plot size.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, if the developers use the TDR (Transfer of Development
                Rights) available with them, they can avail of additional
                vertical construction.
              </p>
              <p>
                BSafal, who will be developing the mall-cum-multiplex project,
                plans to construct more than 9 lakh sq feet built-up space.
                Phoenix Mills Limited (PML) will be managing and operating the
                premium mall.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of the total development, around 6 lakh sq feet will be leasable
                area whereas the rest will be used for setting up facilities
                like parking etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange on Saturday, PML had
                stated, “The company has, on July 21, 2018, entered into a 50:50
                joint venture with Ahmedabad-based BSafal Group to acquire,
                develop, operate and manage a retail mall on land parcel
                admeasuring approximately 5.16 acres (around 25,000 sq yard)
                situated at Thaltej in Ahmedabad.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Chairman of Safal Constructions Pvt. Ltd. Rajesh Brahmbhatt told
                Mirror, “We are excited to partner with Phoenix Mills, the
                pioneer and leader in development and management of large
                Grade-A retail assets in India. Together we will develop a
                premium retail destination in Ahmedabad that will be
                contemporary in design and will house marquee international and
                domestic brands.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Both the groups are in the process of finalising the blueprint
                of the project. The project planning is likely to be ready
                within a month.
              </p>
              <p>
                The mall will come up at a strategically-located spot which is
                near developed residential areas like Thaltej, Shilaj, Hebatpur
                and Bopal.

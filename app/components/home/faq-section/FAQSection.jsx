    question: "What should I consider before buying a property?",
    answer: `Potential buyers need to take into account things like geographical area, available funds, the state of the building, and how the economy is behaving, and also arrange for an affordable return price. It would help to know if their intended residence has no legal issues as well as account for expenses like taxes or maintenance costs.`,
